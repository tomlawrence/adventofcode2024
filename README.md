# Advent of Code 2024

Having looked at several different programming languages I was interested this year, I settled on Go for this year's Avent of Code as a fun way to hopefully get to grips with the language. Coming from a mostly JavaScript/TypeScript and C# background, do not expect my code to be best practices for writing Go.
